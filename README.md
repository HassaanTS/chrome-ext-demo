### Chrome Extension Demo

This is a simple chrome extension made by following a bunch of tutorials and sticking bits of code from the internet together.

The extension can only run on a table format of `GitHub projects` for now and the column values have, for now, been hard-coded since this is supposed to serve a single purpose.
