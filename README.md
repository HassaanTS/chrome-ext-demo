### Chrome Extension Demo     

This is a simple chrome extension made by following a bunch of tutorials and sticking bits of code from the internet together.

The extension can only run on a table format of `GitHub projects` for now and the column values have, for now, been hard-coded since this is supposed to serve a single purpose.


#### Usage
- In chrome, go to `Extensions > Manage Entensions`
- Activate the `Developer mode` option
- Click on `Load unpacked` button and select the project `qlik-trial/git-sum` diretory that is cloned on your system
- It should now appear in your extensions and be ready to use
